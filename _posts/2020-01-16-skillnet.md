## So...what do you do?

Answering this simple question can prove tricky, especially for a liberal arts
student like myself. In my time at university, I've taken classes ranging from
behavioral neurobiology to machine learning and often find myself forging both
abstract and explicit mental connections between subject matters. As a thought
exercise, I set about to map this web of associations using my favorite network
visualization tool, Cytoscape.js.

I hope it can provide a more holistic presentation of my skills, experiences,
and interests. For a more thorough catalog of my background, please see my
resume.
