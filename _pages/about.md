Hi! I'm Spencer, a Data Science and Psychology student at Wesleyan University. At school I
contribute to the [newspaper](http://wesleyanargus.com/user/srdean/) as a Copy Editor and Staff Writer and work for the [Wesleyan Media Project](https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/) as a computational research assistant, aiding the group in collecting and analyzing data on the volume, spending, sponsorship, and content of political
advertising in the U.S.

Outside of school, I've interned at Salesforce, where I received invaluable experience
while working on projects ranging from technical writing to user research and analytics 
(involving both quantitative and qualitative data).

Check out my [resume webpage](https://spencerrdean.github.io/) for more on me!
