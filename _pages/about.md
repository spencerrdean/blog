Hi! I'm a junior studying Psychology and Data Science at Wesleyan
University, where I contribute to the school newspaper, the Wesleyan Argus, as a Copy
Editor and Staff Writer. At school I also work for the Wesleyan Media Project as a
research assistant, aiding a group of computer science and social science professors in
collecting and analyzing data on the volume, spending, sponsorship, and content of
political advertising in the U.S. In my year-and-counting with the Media Project, I have
specialized in analysis of Facebook advertisements in the 2020 presidential election.

Outside of school, I've interned at Salesforce, where I received invaluable experience
with collaboration and communication while working on projects ranging from technical
writing to user research and analytics (involving both quantitative and qualitative data).

Talk about journalism. Shorten
